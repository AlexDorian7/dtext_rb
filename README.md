## About

Uses the [ragel state machine](https://github.com/adrian-thurston/ragel) to generate the dtext parsing capabilities of e621.net

## Getting started

Most of the changes will only need to touch `dtext.rl`, the rest of the files will be generated for you by running either `rake compile` or `rake test`. Take a look at [this inofficial quickstart guide](https://github.com/calio/ragel-cheat-sheet) or the [complete official documentation](http://www.colm.net/files/ragel/ragel-guide-6.10.pdf) if you want to know more about how ragel works.
